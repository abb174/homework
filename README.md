## Overview and Origin
	
    JP Morgan Chase was founded by John Pierpont Morgan in the 19th century. He was an aggressive financier and american banker who was a driving force during the industrial revolution during the gilded age. The House of Morgan was born out of the Drexel and Morgan Co. which was later renamed to JP Morgan and Co in 1895, and now JP Morgan Chase. They are currently the largest bank in the United States by asset value, as well as one of the most respected. The acquisitions and investments they made were a key factor in driving the U.S. economy from “zero to hero” in the Industrial Revolution. JP Morgan and Co  primarily focused on reorganizations and consolidations, but as their reputation grew so did their power. They had their hand in financing many other innovative industries and were praised for revolutionizing the american economy, and commercial banking. 


## Business Activities:

When we fast forward a couple hundred years, JP Morgan evolved to meet dynamic needs. The way they delivered financial services adapted to innovations in technology to help them achieve their mission of becoming the best financial service providers in the world.
One of the biggest problems they are looking to solve is to not become “Amazon-ed” and be rendered irrelevant by some new business process model. They are trying to stand apart from its competitors to maintain their reputation as one of the best financial institutions in the world. One of those innovations is to create their own cryptocurrency coin, because of the recent surge in crypto investors looking to capitalize on their investments. While, JPM coin is no bitcoin, they have been getting a lot more attention in the past few months. JP Morgan services a broad range of clientele. Some examples include individual bankers, corporations, institutions, institutional investors. They are the biggest bank in the country and manage a large sum of assets leading to a huge amount of data that they have compiled over the years. JP Morgan recently invested 11.4 Billion dollars into IT to further develop upon the innovations they have already made. The company utilizes technology such as artificial intelligence, mobile applications, machine-learning, and blockchain technology. It’s an exciting time period for JP Morgan, as they will disrupt the way people and institutions have their financial services rendered.
	
They have been utilizing the data that they have collected along with machine learning technology in order to personalize the digital banking experience. Investors are capable of receiving the research they need to drive their investments much more easily since the machine learning technology gives them easier access to the specific research they need. JP Morgan is the first to utilize an AI powered Virtual Assistant out of all the other major banks. Not only will it make it easier for corporate clients to move money all around the world, but coincided with the machine learning technology that they employ, the AI assistant is able to learn from the user and adapt to their behavior and ideas.  JP Morgan has been working on a number of projects and innovations utilizing blockchain technology since its been at the forefront of technologists minds. One of those projects is Quorum, an enterprise based platform built with open-source code. Another is the creation of their own crypto coin.




## Landscape:

JP Morgan has their hand in a lot of narrow niches of the financial industry, but on a broader scope they dominate within the banking industry. For decades, they have been the biggest bank in the country. Competitors in the industry have also become more modernized to meet the changing demands of consumers. The biggest competitors are Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and many other smaller players. Within the banking domain, innovations such as: digital account opening, person-to-person payments, video collaboration,Cloud computing, and APIs.

## Results

* At JP Morgan Chase, they are investing in our customers, employees, and communities around the world to break down barriers to opportunity. With the resources they have they are trying to combine their business and philanthropic expertise to cultivate thriving communities. From banking standard financial performance metrics such as return on assets and return on equity to more operationally-focused metrics such as customer service satisfaction scores, number of new accounts opened, and time saved. When we look at the financials of JP Morgan compared to the financials of other big banks in the country. Some of the most important metrics to analyze in a company are liquidity, solvency, profitability, and operating efficiency. When we analyze these factors from the balance sheet we are able to see that JP Morgan has a leg up in the competition. Not only do they provide a broad range of financial services, but they also generate the most revenue out of all the major competitors. 


## Recommendations

Even when JP Morgan is highly respected within their respective domain, they continue to want to drive innovation in order to meet consumer demands. I believe the recent creation of their own coin will drive more people to invest in cryptocurrency since many of the more popular coins have shown growth in the past year. As technology changes, more americans are going to have more faith in investing in cryptocurrency since it will be more accessible for consumers. It is a smart idea to get into the game now, before any of the other commercial banks enter the niche. I also recommend JP Morgan to leverage the large amount of consumer data that they have to make a lot of their digital platforms more user friendly, especially for people in underprivileged communities. Investing more heavily into the AI technology and machine learning algorithms they use will drive better analysis, and provide a better overall consumer experience. JP Morgan produces a lot of research, but so many of their customer base do not even  know how to access it. If the machine learning algorithms can further personalize the banking experience, I believe it would provide them with a huge leg up in the competition. There still remain some barriers for consumers in underprivileged communities to have access to a lot of these technological innovations, but in time that gap will be bridged together so that it is available to a broader customer base.
